# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Use of useState() -->
1. state management
2. conditional rendering 
3. Toggle flax(true/false)
4. Counter
5. Store API data in state



* 1. declare a state to hold the data (useSate declareing)
* 2. use effect with callback function and dependecy array
* 3. use fetch to load the data




Effect -> setting up server connection 

Side effect of React 
-> not predictable
-> action performed with 'outside world'
-> when we need to reach outside the scope of component
